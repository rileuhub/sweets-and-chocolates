    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p>Sweets & Chocolates Galore started in 1997 when we saw a need for more exotic options in the sweets and chocolates area.
    We examined the overseas market and found there were certain favourites that were in demand in various countries.
    We set up a small shop in the Atrium mall and started importing specialised ranges of sweets and chocolates from Italy,
    France, and some of the Asian markets where they have very different varieties.
    Since we opened our website word has got around and now the majority of our sales are online.
    Please email an order to us and we will endeavour to fulfil your needs.
    Thanks for your continuing support.
